find-file-sync [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fiveisprime/find-file-sync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fiveisprime/find-file-sync) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/find-file-sync.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/find-file-sync)
==============

Find a file recursively from top to bottom. Synchronously.

# Example

Return the first file found in the specified directory with the specified name:

``` js
var findFileSync = require('find-file-sync');
var file = findFileSync(process.cwd(), 'file.js');
```

Find a file in a directory ignoring specific directories:

``` js
var findFileSync = require('find-file-sync');

// Exclude an array of directories or a single directory.
var packageJson = findFileSync(process.cwd(), 'package.json', [ 'node_modules', '.git' ]);
var main = findFileSync(process.cwd(), 'index.js', 'node_modules');
```

Find files from an array of possibilities. This will return the first of any of
the files in the array:

``` js
var findFileSync = require('find-file-sync');

// Exclude an array of directories or a single directory.
var main = findFileSync(process.cwd(), ['index.js', 'app.js', 'server.js'], [ 'node_modules', '.git' ]);
```
